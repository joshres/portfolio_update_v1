        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>After spending some time in college, I joined the military for a few years. It helped me learn how to be independent, while also learning the value of working with a team. After the military I worked as a security guard but ultimately found a greater appreciation for cooking.</p>
        <p>I’ve become very attentive to detail and love problem solving. I am always ready to learn something new and expand my abilites as an individual and as a team member. </p>

        <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
        <p>After working in very different industries, I have gained a lot of knowledge about each one. The most important thing I have learned that is equally applicable to all, is how important having an attention to detail is. Whether it is checking every door in a building to make sure they are all locked, or reading a recipe to find the appropriate unit of measurement, attention to detail is what makes something go from good to great.</p>
