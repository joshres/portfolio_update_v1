        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring web designer who loves learning new skills. I have worked most recently as a professional cook and can see many parallels between cooking and coding. I’m looking forward to growing in an exciting field that I am ready to sink my teeth into.</p>
        <p>I’ve become very attentive to detail and love problem solving. I am always ready to learn something new and expand my abilites as an individual and as a team member. </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I’d like to spend some time becoming very comfortable with JavaScript before I see what direction I would like to take in my web development career. After I become more acclimated to the working world in web development, I will pursue learning more advanced languages and more advanced concepts of languages I may already know.</p>
